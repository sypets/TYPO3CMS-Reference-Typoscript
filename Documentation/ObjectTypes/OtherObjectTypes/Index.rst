==================
Other Object Types
==================

These are **object types** (=complex data types) which specify TypoScript objects.

Most complex data types are a special form of

* :ref:`content object type (cObject) <data-type-cobject>`
* :ref:`menu object type <data-type-menuobj>`

Here, we handle object types, that are not cObject object types:
